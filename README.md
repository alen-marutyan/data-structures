# Data Structures

## 1. Stack

>Stack follows the principle of LIFO (last In, first out). If you stack books, the top book will be taken before the bottom one. When you browse on the internet, the back button leads you to the most recently browsed page.
> 
> ```npm run stack```
> 
> When we start the script we push 3 element to the stack and showing our elements, pop method removing the last element we pushed, then we using peek method to see last pushed element , in the end we printing our stack length.


## 2. Queue

>Queue is similar to stack. The only difference is that queue uses the FIFO principle (first in, first out). In other words, when you queue for the bus, the first in the queue will always board first.
>
>```npm run queue```
> 
> Queue is a data structere. Using push method we add element to our queue  from the last and using enqueue method we delete from the first.
