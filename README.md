# Data Structures

## 1. Stack

>A stack is a data structure that follows the principle of LIFO (last in, first out). It can be used to keep track of the most recently added elements and to perform operations such as push (add to top) and pop (remove from top).

> ```npm run stack```

## 2. Queue

>A queue is a data structure that follows the principle of FIFO (first in, first out). It can be used to process elements in the order they were added, and to perform operations such as enqueue (add to back) and dequeue (remove from front).
>
>```npm run queue```
>

## 3. Set

>A set is a data structure in which each element is unique and appears only once. It can be used to check for the presence of an element in constant time, and to eliminate duplicate elements from a collection. A Set is commonly used in computer science to perform operations such as union, intersection, and difference between two sets.
